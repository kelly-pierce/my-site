								<h2>Background</h2>
								<p>I'm former full-time athlete and Virginia native who finds herself back in the Old Dominion (just in time for the seventeen year cicadas, joy) after a decade away in New Jersey and California for school and training. I graduated from the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in 2008 and went on to get my A.B. in History from Princeton University in 2012, where I was team captain of the Openweight Women's Rowing and NCAA Division I Champion. Immediately after graduating I began training with the U.S. Rowing Women's National Team for the 2016 and 2020 Summer Olympics.</p>
								<p>Injuries prevented me from achieving my goal of making either Olympic team, despite numerous appearances at the World Rowing Championships, many National-level first place finishes, and several individual World Records -- notably the Women's 6k erogmeter. Training year-round, six-to-seven days per week and two-to-three times per day while also working up to 40 hours per week was the hardest thing I have ever done, but also the most rewarding. Though I have only some minor hardware (and many broken ribs) to show for my seven years as an Olympic hopeful, I regret nothing. </p>
								<h2>Now what?</h2>
								<p>After working in the worlds of private investment and the energy industry to support myself while training, I've returned to my first love: design. I've been a hobby artist since I was old enough to hold a crayon. My tweenage years were spent haunting DeviantArt and Elfwood, tinkering with the html in my Neopets shopfront, and messing around trying to find the *perfect* cursor for my Geocities page. I spent countless hours painting on <i>oekaki</i> boards with friends and even fried my motherboard in seventh grade trying to run Photoshop and Paint Shop Pro at the same time on my poorly ventilated (and apparently overclocked) Dell desktop. In college these same skills made me the go-to person for designing team t-shirts and left me in charge of the (super-critical) operation to photoshop friends into pictures of events they missed. These activities took a back seat after graduation when I began full-time training, but I'm thrilled now to rekindle my relationship with design.</p>
								<p>This site is dedicated to cataloguing my efforts at art, design, and UX improvement. I'll be updating it on a regular basis -- be sure to check back and see what I'm up to.</p>
